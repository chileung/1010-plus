## Why would I develop 1010!-plus ?
One day my girlfriend, Soyi, found a very interesting game named [**1010!**](http://www.wandoujia.com/apps/com.gramgames.tenten), which has advertisements on the top of the screen.

She encouraged me to develop a similar version without advertisement. Well, I don't think that anyone can reject begs from a beautiful & sexy girl.

So I started to develop this game via HTML5, which costed me almost about 1 week.( of course not my normal work time )

This game is not for business, it is only for fun and study.

I will overwrite it via cocos2d-js for study in the future.

## What I hope ?
**Just for fun !**

If you feel interested, please star me so that I can own my first star. :)

Also welcome to fix bugs that I haven't found according to pull request.

## TODO
- Special voice for every elimination.
- Set some kinds of rank system for more challenge.
- An achievement system is also in great need.
